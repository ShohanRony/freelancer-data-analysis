- Platforms (Upwork, Fiverr, Freelancer, etc.)
- Experience levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Expert)
- Client regions
- Payment methods
- Project types (Fixed, Hourly)
- Performance metrics (earnings, success rates, client ratings)
- Business metrics (job completion, rehire rates, marketing spend)

## Analysis Highlights
- Distribution and statistical analysis of earnings across different demographics
- Correlation analysis between key performance indicators
- Platform comparison for different job categories and experience levels
- Success factor identification for high-earning freelancers
- Client satisfaction and rating patterns
- Impact of marketing spend on earnings and rehire rates
- Project type analysis (Fixed vs Hourly) and optimal pricing strategies
