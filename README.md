# Freelancer Data Analysis

## Overview
This project conducts a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of freelancers across multiple platforms. The analysis examines key factors influencing freelancer success, earnings potential, and client satisfaction across different job categories, experience levels, and platforms.

## Dataset
The dataset contains detailed information about freelancers including:

- Job categories (Web Development, Data Entry, Content Writing, etc.)
- Platforms (Upwork, Fiverr, Freelancer, etc.)
- Experience levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Expert)
- Client regions
- Payment methods
- Project types (Fixed, Hourly)
- Performance metrics (earnings, success rates, client ratings)
- Business metrics (job completion, rehire rates, marketing spend)

For a complete description of all variables, see the [Data Dictionary](data_dictionary.md).

## Analysis Highlights
- Distribution and statistical analysis of earnings across different demographics
- Correlation analysis between key performance indicators
- Platform comparison for different job categories and experience levels
- Success factor identification for high-earning freelancers
- Client satisfaction and rating patterns
- Impact of marketing spend on earnings and rehire rates
- Project type analysis (Fixed vs Hourly) and optimal pricing strategies
