[PROJECT] Comprehensive Analysis of Freelancer Success Factors

Hi everyone,

I recently completed a data analysis project examining the key factors that influence freelancer success across different platforms. The analysis covers earnings patterns, client satisfaction drivers, and platform comparison data from 1,000+ freelancers.

Some interesting findings:
- Technical specialists earn 3.2x more than generalists
- Client relationships have 3.7x more value than new client acquisition
- Optimal marketing spend falls between 5-10% of earnings

I've documented the entire analysis process, including data cleaning, statistical analysis, and business recommendations. The repository includes a comprehensive data dictionary, visualization gallery, and skills showcase.
